# Emoji Reactions Add-On for ExpressionEngine 7

This add-on was built as a part of my talk at the July 2023 EEConf meet-up. 

It allows users to react to Channel Entries with emojis, and provides an admin Control Panel back end for viewing all reactions. It also demonstrates how Widgets and Prolets are built and how they can be used.
